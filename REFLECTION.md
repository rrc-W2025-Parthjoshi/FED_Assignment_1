# Reflection

## 1. Can I explain what my code does?

Yes, This project is a personal resume webpage built with HTML 5.The code is structured with a header tag for my introduction, a main tag containing multiple section elements for contact information, about me, skills, education, experience, projects, SVG icons, and extras, and a footer tag for copyright and contact links. The sections use headings and lists to organize content clearly and make navigation easy. Images and SVGs include alt attributes for accessibility, and a skip link allows users to quickly access the main content. All links, including my GitHub and email, are functional and are safe to open target="_blank" and rel="noopener".

## 2. What was my coding process?

I started by figuring out what sections I need in my resume. Then I made the HTML file and added the structure using semantic tags. I just added content bit by bit, committing changes to Git along the way. After that, I used images, SVGs, and links, making sure they worked and accessible. At the end, I checked the HTML with the W3C validator and made some final tweaks.

## 3. What challenges did I have?

One thing that was kind of tricky for me was figuring out the best way to organize all the sections so it didn’t look messy. Adding the SVG icons and making sure the alt texts made sense also took a bit of time. I had to double-check the links and images a few times to make sure everything worked. Coming up with meaningful Git commits was also one of the biggest time consuming tasks.

## What would I do differently now?

Next time, I would spend more time planning and organizing the sections before starting, to avoid having to tweak things later. I’d also test links and images as I go instead of waiting until the end, just to save some time. Also, I’d try to come up with better Git commit messages.
